## Verify Installations / Update Default Python

## This has been completed. 

In VS Code, open a terminal window (View / Terminal).
If macOS/Linux, change `python` to `python3` in the commands below.

```shell
git --version
python --version
python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel
```

## Execute Utility Script (Diagnostics)

## This has been completed and produced the results in "util_about.txt"

With your repo folder open in VS Code:

1. Click util_about.py.
1. If VS Code prompts, install the recommended Python extension.
1. Check the Python Interpreter: On the bottom-left status bar, you might see a version of Python indicated (e.g., Python 3.10.x).
1. If not, click on the bottom status bar where it should show the Python version or might say "Select Python Interpreter".
1. From the dropdown, choose your default Python version.
1. In VS Code, open a terminal window (View / Terminal).
1. If macOS/Linux, change `python` to `python3` below.

```shell
python util_about.py
```

## Explore & Execute Project Scripts

## This has been completed and I have created the CSV files required

## Update Edit README

## This has been completed. 

## Sync to GitHub

## This has been completed. 

Now it's time to get the local work you did on your machine, 
back up to your cloud repo in GitHub.


### Option A: Use VS Code (Easy!)

## I chose option B, I did not do option A

### Option B: Use Git Bash or Terminal Commands (Easy as well):

## I chose this option and it executed as expected. 

Open a new `Git Bash` or Terminal window. Run the following commands one at a time.
They will first add all the files (add "dot"). 
Then they will commit the changes with a message. 
Finally, they will push the changes up to GitHub.

```
git add .
git commit -m "initial results"
git push origin main
```

## General Recommendations and Troubleshooting

The following are general recommendations and troubleshooting tips.

### Issue: VS Code - No Source Control Icon

Suggestion: If you're in VS Code, and you don't see the Source Control icon with a blue bubble, right-click on the sidebar icons, and make sure "Source Control" is checked.  

### Issue: VS Code wants to install an extension

If VS Code suggests an extension, it's often good to go ahead and try it. 
Do a search on the extension to learn more. VS Code suggestions are usually helpful.
